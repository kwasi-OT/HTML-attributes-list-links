                <img src="images/playa-flamenco.avif" alt="playa-flamenco, culebra, puerto rico" title="Playa Flamenco, Culebra, Puerto Rico">
                <p>Stretching for a mile around a sheltered, horseshoe-shaped bay, Playa Flamenco (Flamenco Beach) is not only one of Culebra’s best beaches, it also makes a regular appearance on the world's best beaches lists.</p>
                <p>It gets its name from the nearby lagoon, which attracts flamingos in winter. If you plan to visit during this time, you’ll feel like Robinson Crusoe contemplating the clarity of the water.</p>
                <p>Backed by low scrub and trees rather than lofty palms, Flamenco gets very crowded on weekends and holidays, especially with day-trippers from San Juan, so plan a weekday visit. Alone among Culebra's beaches, it has a full range of amenities.</p>

                <h2>Stiftsbibliothek</h2>
                <img src="images/Stiftsbibliothek_St_Gallen.avif" alt="Stiftsbibliothek, Switzerland" title="Stiftsbibliothek, in Northeastern Switzerland">
                <p>If the greatest masterpieces on earth are wrought for the glory of God, St Gallen’s Stiftsbibliothek (Abbey Library), is like a living prayer. Religious or not, you can’t help but look up to the heavens and fall silent as you step across its creaking wood floor, breathe in the scent of 1000 years of parchment, ink, patience and piety, and cast a careful eye across its stucco-encrusted ceiling, biblical frescoes, playful putti (cherub-like figures), magnificent globe and shelves lined with 170,000 beautiful leather-bound books. Some of the world’s most precious and elaborate medieval manuscripts are hidden here, occasionally dusted off for exhibitions for all to admire.</p>
                <p>Once the beating heart of one of Europe’s finest Benedictine monasteries, the library gave St Gallen a solid foot up the celestial ladder in the Middle Ages. Today, this wondrous space forms the centerpiece of the Unesco World Heritage Stiftsbezirk (Abbey District). If you make the pilgrimage to just one abbey in Switzerland, this really should be it.</p>
