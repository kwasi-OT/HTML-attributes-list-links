            <h2>Playa Flamenco</h2>
            <img src="/images/playa-flamenco.avif" alt="playa-flamenco, culebra, puerto rico" title="Playa Flamenco, Culebra, Puerto Rico" width="640px" height="360px">
            <p>Stretching for a mile around a sheltered, horseshoe-shaped bay, Playa Flamenco (Flamenco Beach) is not only one of Culebra’s best beaches, it also makes a regular appearance on the world's best beaches lists.</p>
            <p>It gets its name from the nearby lagoon, which attracts flamingos in winter. If you plan to visit during this time, you’ll feel like Robinson Crusoe contemplating the clarity of the water.</p>
            <p>Backed by low scrub and trees rather than lofty palms, Flamenco gets very crowded on weekends and holidays, especially with day-trippers from San Juan, so plan a weekday visit. Alone among Culebra's beaches, it has a full range of amenities.</p>
