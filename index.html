            <h2>Playa Flamenco</h2>
            <img src="images/playa-flamenco.avif" alt="playa-flamenco, culebra, puerto rico" title="Playa Flamenco, Culebra, Puerto Rico" width="640px" height="360px">
            <p>Stretching for a mile around a sheltered, horseshoe-shaped bay, Playa Flamenco (Flamenco Beach) <br> is not only one of Culebra’s best beaches, it also makes a regular appearance on the world's best beaches lists.</p>
            <p>It gets its name from the nearby lagoon, which attracts flamingos in winter. <br> If you plan to visit during this time, you’ll feel like Robinson Crusoe contemplating the clarity of the water.</p>
            <p>Backed by low scrub and trees rather than lofty palms, Flamenco gets very crowded on weekends and holidays, especially with day-trippers from San Juan, <br> so plan a weekday visit. Alone among Culebra's beaches, it has a full range of amenities.</p>

            <h2>Stiftsbibliothek</h2>
            <img src="images/Stiftsbibliothek_St_Gallen.avif" alt="Stiftsbibliothek, Switzerland" title="Stiftsbibliothek, in Northeastern Switzerland" width="640px" height="360px">
            <p>If the greatest masterpieces on earth are wrought for the glory of God, St Gallen’s Stiftsbibliothek (Abbey Library), is like a living prayer. <br> Religious or not, you can’t help but look up to the heavens and fall silent as you step across its creaking wood floor, <br>breathe in the scent of 1000 years of parchment, ink, patience and piety, and cast a careful eye across its stucco-encrusted ceiling,<br> biblical frescoes, playful putti (cherub-like figures), magnificent globe and shelves lined with 170,000 beautiful leather-bound books. <br> Some of the world’s most precious and elaborate medieval manuscripts are hidden here, occasionally dusted off for exhibitions for all to admire.</p>
            <p>Once the beating heart of one of Europe’s finest Benedictine monasteries, the library gave St Gallen a solid foot up the celestial ladder in the Middle Ages. <br> Today, this wondrous space forms the centerpiece of the Unesco World Heritage Stiftsbezirk (Abbey District). <br> If you make the pilgrimage to just one abbey in Switzerland, this really should be it.</p>
